# Game-Analysis-Using-SQL
 Introduction 
 In the gaming industry, understanding player behavior and engagement is crucial for enhancing user experience and game design. Our goal was to analyze various aspects of gameplay to gain insights into:
 
 üî∑Player progression across levels and difficulty settings.
 
 üî∑Player engagement metrics.
 
 üî∑Device performance impacts on gameplay.
 
 üî∑Overall progress tracking and performance metrics.

## Efforts Towards the Solution:
To address these challenges, I executed a series of complex SQL queries and employed advanced SQL techniques. Here‚Äôs a summary of the key tasks:

 Q1) Extract P_ID,Dev_ID,PName and Difficulty_level of all players at level 0.
